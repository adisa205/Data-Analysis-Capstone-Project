# Data-Analysis-Capstone-Project

This is where i started my Repository for the Capstone  Project for the DSA Data Analysis.

I have learnt a lot of things ranging from Microsoft Excel to SQL, in continuation of the project creation of my Portfolio.

## Project Overview

### Excel Project Overview
This project for RetailTech Insights involved analyzing Amazon product and customer review data. The goal was to generate insights for product improvement, marketing, and customer engagement. Key tasks included calculating discounts, product counts, review totals, identifying top products by rating/reviews, and creating a comprehensive Excel dashboard for visualization.

### SQL Project Overview
This project analyzes Kultra Mega Stores' 2009-2012 sales data, imported from Excel into SQL Server. Using SSMS, SQL queries are run to uncover key business insights, identify top/bottom performing product categories/regions, analyze customer value, and evaluate shipping cost efficiency. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to management for improved sales, profitability, and operations.
