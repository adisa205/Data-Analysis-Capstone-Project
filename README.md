# Data-Analysis-Capstone-Project

This is where i started my Repository for the Capstone  Project for the DSA Data Analysis.

I have learnt a lot of things ranging from Microsoft Excel to SQL, in continuation of the project creation of my Portfolio.

## Project Overview

### Microsoft Excel Project Overview
This project for RetailTech Insights involved analyzing Amazon product and customer review data. The goal was to generate insights for product improvement, marketing, and customer engagement. Key tasks included calculating discounts, product counts, review totals, identifying top products by rating/reviews, and creating a comprehensive Excel dashboard for visualization.

### SQL Project Overview
This project analyzes Kultra Mega Stores' 2009-2012 sales data, imported from Excel into SQL Server. Using SSMS, SQL queries are run to uncover key business insights, identify top/bottom performing product categories/regions, analyze customer value, and evaluate shipping cost efficiency. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to management for improved sales, profitability, and operations.

### Microsoft Excel Data Source
The data source for this project was a CSV file named Amazon case study.xlsx - amazon.csv.

### SQL Data Source
The primary data source for this project is an Excel file (CSV format) named KMS Sql Case Study.csv, containing order data from Kultra Mega Stores spanning 2009 to 2012.

### Microsoft Excel Data Tools
Microsoft Excel( I used it for Cleaning, Analysing and Visualizing

### SQL Data Tools

Microsoft SQL Server: This is the relational database management system I used to store and manage the Kultra Mega Stores order data.

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): This is the integrated environment used to access, configure, manage, administer, and develop all components of SQL Server. I used it for tasks like importing the CSV data and executing SQL queries.

Import Flat File Wizard (within SSMS): This specific feature of SSMS was used to import  KMS Sql Case Study.csv file into a SQL Server table.
